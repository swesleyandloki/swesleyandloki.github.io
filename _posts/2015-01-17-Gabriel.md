##Introducing the mobile application for job applications


**Gabriel is an app that I worked on for iPhone and android that allows you to apply to job postings on AngelList by swiping right!**  

####This app is incredibly lightweight!
It comes in **UNDER 2 MB!**

####Because it is built with **FAMO.US** and **CORDOVA**

####OAuth.io connects you directly to the AngelList back end:

####Gabriel functions by pulling data from your AngelList profile to present you with one job at a time that fits your skills and location:

####You can flip the card over to scroll through the job description:

####You can swipe cards right, or push a button to apply to jobs:
####Similarly, they can swipe left to archive positions:
