##Hack Reactor is AMAZEBALLS!!!

**But Jesus H Christ I need a nap**  I found out that Hack Reactor is way more than everything I thought it would be.  It's really good that they have free coffee here.

##This week we're learning about **CLASSES**!

And I'm finding out referring to groups of related objects as **instances** of a **class** in **JavaScript**is somewhat controversial.  But whether or not you'd like to call them classes, here's how you set them up:  

{% highlight javascript %}
//To make a class Dog:

var Dog = function(breed, age){
	this.breed = breed;
	this.age = age;
}
Dog.prototype.bark = function(){
	console.log('woof');
}

//To create a subclass of Dog:

var Puppy = function(breed, age){
	Dog.apply(this, breed, age);
	this.cute = true;
}
Puppy.prototype = Object.create(Dog.prototype);
//remember to hook up the prototype or your puppy won't bark!
{% endhighlight %}

Send me good vibes please world...
