title: I want to go to Hack Reactor!
---

##I've been learning to code!

**Hello World!**  I am trying to teach myself the way to web developer success.  It's been going pretty well so far.  I've been working towards learning **javascript**, and I feel like I'm getting somewhere.  Codecademy and codeschool have both been pretty helpful, and they have taught me a lot in a short time about javascript, jQuery, html5, and CSS.

##But I want to learn even **FASTER**!

And the best way I can think to learn even faster is to surround myself with bright, curious people also trying to learn more.  And I want to do that at **HACKREACTOR**.

{% highlight javascript %}
var stillTryingToGetIn = true;
while(stillTryingToGetIn){
  I have applied to hackreactor;
  I have completed their web application challenge by myself during my second ever week of trying to code;
  I have been interviewed twice;
  I have demonstrated great improvement between interviews but still have not been accepted;
  };
  //I am trapped in an infinite application loop!
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];

{% endhighlight %}
 
As you can see, I've started trying to get my hands dirty in GitHub, and have now also familiarized myself with git commands and iTerm2.  Hopefully, those at HackReactor will be monitoring my progress and _deem me worthy_ soon.
 
Send me good vibes please world...
