##I have been working my way through Famo.us University

**Famo.us is a really fun framework that makes css animations easy**  It hooks in to the 16 digit CSS transform matrix and lets you program in javascript.  Easy!

##Every visible rendered DOM node in famo.us is a **surface**.
##To animate a surface you can use **modifiers** and **transforms**.

**Modifiers** are used to position a **surface**, specify its properties, and also to set the anchor point on the surface that will be used by all subsequent **transforms**.
This anchor point is called the **origin**.

So for instance if you wanted to make a blue square:

{% highlight javascript %}

//require what you need from the famous core library:

var Engine = require('famous/core/Engine');
var Surface = require('famous/core/Surface');
var Transform = require('famous/core/Transform');
var StateModifier = require('famous/modifiers/StateModifier');

//create a main context in which to render your surface:

var mainContext = Engine.createContext();

//create your surface instance:

var square = new Surface({
  size: [100, 100],
  properties: {
    backgroundColor: 'blue'
  }
});

//render your surface by adding it to the main context:

mainContext.add(firstSurface);

{% endhighlight %}

if we wanted this square to spin in a circle, we could rotate it in the z-direction like so:

{% highlight javascript %}

var initialTime = Date.now();

var modifier = new StateModifier({
  transform: Transform.rotateZ(Date.now()-initialTime);
});

//The modifier gets added to the main context first, and the surface chained after it is modified in that manner:

mainContext.add(modifier).add(surface);

{% endhighlight %}

This is cool, but the square will spin around its upper left corner because that is its default **origin**.
If we want the square to spin around its center point, we need to specify that by editing the **modifier** like so:

{% highlight javascript %}

var modifier = new StateModifier({
  origin: [0.5, 0.5],
  transform: Transform.rotateZ(Date.now()-initialTime);
});

//Setting the origin to [0.5,0.5] means that the anchor point on any chained surface will be half of its height and half of its length from the top:
//Then we add to the context as before:

mainContext.add(modifier).add(surface);

{% endhighlight %}

This will give us a blue square that spins like a nice pinwheel!

Famo.us university is awesome and fun, go check it out :)
